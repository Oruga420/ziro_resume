You will use the resume file and build a website that will be deploy on vercel the website should use blue tones be develop on next js have at least 1 cool effect
the website needst to have the sections i nthe order specified on the mockup website.png file 
the website should include only the information from the given summary nothing else nothing less
the website should be easy to read 
the website should be quick to load
keep security tide
no data bases
nothing additional to the template sections.
The resume will vary in name so let the user tell you the name of the summary and u start building the code when the website is ready ask the user for the github repo
using github cli deploy to the repo
once the main deploy is done you will create prs for all upcomming changes 1 module per pr unless tell other wise by the user
if the change will be several modules create a branch and work on that one then using separate prs we merge 
always include a download website as a PDF where I want the website as it sees on the screen to be printed as a pdf and downloaded
make the website white easy to read the blue contrast dark blue make it look childish
